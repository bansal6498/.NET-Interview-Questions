#### How do you ensure clean, efficient, and maintainable code?
**Answer:**
"I follow coding best practices, such as writing clear and concise code, adhering to namingconventions, and keeping functions and classes small and focused on a single responsibility. I also perform code reviews and use static code analysis tools to detect potential issues. Proper documentation and writing unit tests also help in maintaining code quality."
#### What is your approach to mentoring junior developers?
**Answer:**
"I believe in providing guidance through code reviews, pair programming, and constructive feedback. I also help junior developers understand the bigger picture by explaining why certain decisions are made. I encourage them to ask questions and learn continuously by solving realworld problems and focusing on best practices."
#### How do you manage working with offshore teams, especially when collaborating with teams in different time zones?
**Answer:**
"I ensure effective communication by scheduling regular meetings that accommodate different time zones, such as daily standups or weekly reviews. I use collaboration tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams for asynchronous communication and track progress on JIRA. I focus on clear documentation to ensure everyone understands the project’s requirements, regardless of time zone differences."
#### Can you explain event-driven architecture and its benefits?
**Answer:**
"Event-driven architecture is a design pattern where components of a system communicate by emitting and handling events. This decouples the components, allowing them to operate independently. I have used this pattern in applications with asynchronous processing needs, such as updating databases or sending notifications when certain actions occur. It provides scalability and improves the responsiveness of applications."
