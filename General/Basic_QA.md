*Question-** How do you manage working with offshore teams, especially when collaborating with teams in different time zones?
<br>
**Answer-** "I ensure effective communication by scheduling regular meetings that accommodate different time zones, such as daily standups or weekly reviews.

**Question-** Can you explain event-driven architecture and its benefits?
<br>
**Answer-** "Event-driven architecture is a design pattern where components of a system communicate by emitting and handling events. This decouples the components, allowing them to operate independently. I have used this pattern in applications with asynchronous processing needs, such as updating databases or sending notifications when certain actions occur. It provides scalability and improves the responsiveness of applications."
