**Question**- What experience do you have with C# and .NET? Can you describe a project where you used them?
<br>
**Answer:** "I have worked extensively with C# and .NET, including .NET Core, in developing various enterprise-level applications. In one project, I developed a web application using ASP.NET Core MVC, where I implemented complex business logic using C# and integrated it with an Oracledatabase. I also created APIs using Web API, ensuring they followed best practices for performance and security."

**Question**- How do you implement security in .NET Core applications?
<br>
**Answer:** Security can be implemented in .NET Core applications by using: • Authentication: Verify the identity of users via JWT tokens, cookie-based authentication, or third-party providers like OAuth. • Authorization: Use role-based or policy-based authorization to control access to application.

**Question**- What is your experience with APIs, and how do you test them?
<br>
**Answer:** "I have developed RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API, and I ensure they are welldocumented using tools like Swagger. I test APIs using Postman, where I write test cases to check for expected responses, status codes, and error handling. I also use unit tests to ensure API controllers function as expected."

In the onshore/offshore model, I have collaborated with both onshore teams and offshore developers. We used tools like JIRA for tracking progress, and I was involved in daily standups, sprint planning, and code reviews to ensure alignment between teams."
