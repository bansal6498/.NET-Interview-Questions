**Answer:** "I have worked extensively with C# and .NET, including .NET Core, in developing various enterprise-level applications. In one project, I developed a web application using ASP.NET Core MVC, where I implemented complex business logic using C# and integrated it with an Oracledatabase. I also created APIs using Web API, ensuring they followed best practices for performance and security."
