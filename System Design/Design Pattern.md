## Design Pattern
-   **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
-   **Factory Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of created objects.
-   **Observer Pattern**: Used to allow a subject to notify its observers of changes, typically used in event-driven programming.
-   **Decorator Pattern**: Allows functionality to be added to an object dynamically.
-   **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
-   **Repository Pattern**: Used for accessing data from different sources in a clean and decoupled way.
