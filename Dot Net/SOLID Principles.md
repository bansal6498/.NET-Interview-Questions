## SOLID Principles
**SOLID** is an acronym for five design principles that help create more maintainable and scalable software:
-   **S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** â€“ A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job.
-   **O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** â€“ Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
-   **L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** â€“ Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
-   **I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** â€“ A client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use.
-   **D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** â€“ High-level modules should not depend on lowlevel modules; both should depend on abstractions.
