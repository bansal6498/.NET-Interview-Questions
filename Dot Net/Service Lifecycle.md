### Service Lifecycle in .NET Core
In ASP.NET Core, services are registered in the Dependency Injection (DI) container and they have specific lifecycles that determine when and how instances of those services are created.</br>
There are three main service lifecycles in .NET Core:

**1.    Transient Service (Transient)**- 
A transient service is created each time it is requested. Every time the service is injected into a constructor or requested from the DI container, a new instance is created.
-   **Use Case:** Use transient services for lightweight, stateless services where each request requires a fresh instance.
#### 🧩 Example
```csharp
public class TransientService
{
    public Guid OperationId { get; } = Guid.NewGuid();
}
```
#### Registration
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<TransientService>();
}
```
#### Usage
```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly TransientService _transientService;
    public HomeController(TransientService transientService)
    {
        _transientService = transientService;
    }
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var operationId = _transientService.OperationId; // Each request will have a different GUID
        return View();
    }
}
```
**Characteristics:**
-   New instance every time it is requested.
-   Ideal for lightweight, stateless services.
-   Overuse of transient services may lead to performance issues due to frequent creation of instances.

**2.    Scoped Service (Scoped)**- 
A scoped service is created once per request within a scope. This means a new instance of the service is created for each HTTP request, but it is reused within the same request (e.g., for different parts of the same controller).
-   **Use Case:** Use scoped services for services that need to maintain state within a request but do not need to persist across multiple requests.
#### 🧩 Example
```csharp
public class ScopedService
{
    public Guid OperationId { get; } = Guid.NewGuid();
}
```
#### Registration
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddScoped<ScopedService>();
}
```
#### Usage
```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly ScopedService _scopedService;
    public HomeController(ScopedService scopedService)
    {
        _scopedService = scopedService;
    }
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var operationId = _scopedService.OperationId; // Same GUID within a single request
        return View();
    }
}
```
**Characteristics:**
-   A new instance per HTTP request.
-   Maintains state for the duration of a request.
-   Suitable for services that need to track a user’s activity across the request lifecycle (e.g., database context).

**3.    Singleton Service (Singleton)**- 
A singleton service is created once and shared across the entire application's lifetime. Only one instance of a singleton service is created, and it is reused across all requests and even throughout the entire application lifecycle.
-   **Use Case:** Use singleton services for services that do not hold state or that need to be shared globally (e.g., logging, configuration, caching).
#### 🧩 Example
```csharp
public class SingletonService
{
    public Guid OperationId { get; } = Guid.NewGuid();
}
```
#### Registration
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton<SingletonService>();
}
```
#### Usage
```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly SingletonService _singletonService;
    public HomeController(SingletonService singletonService)
    {
        _singletonService = singletonService;
    }
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var operationId = _singletonService.OperationId; // Same GUID for every request
        return View();
    }
}
```
**Characteristics:**
-   A single instance across the entire application.
-   Ideal for services that are stateless or hold application-wide state.
-   Can have thread-safety concerns if not handled properly (especially in multi-threaded environments).</br>
### When to Use Each
-   **Transient:**
Use for lightweight services that do not maintain state across requests and are cheap to instantiate.</br>
Example: A simple utility class or a service that processes individual transactions.
-   **Scoped:**
Use for services that need to maintain state for a single request, such as database context objects.</br>
Example: A service that interacts with a database using Entity Framework.
-   **Singleton:**
Use for services that are expensive to create, do not hold request-specific state, and can be shared across the application.</br>
Example: Configuration services, logging services, or caching services.
