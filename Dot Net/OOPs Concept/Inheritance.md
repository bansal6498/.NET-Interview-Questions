## Inheritance
Inheritance is an object-oriented programming concept where a new class (derived class or child class) can inherit properties, methods, and fields from an existing class (base class or parent class). This allows code reuse and extension of functionality.
-   **Base Class:** The class that provides the properties and methods.
-   **Derived Class:** The class that inherits the properties and methods of the base class.
### Key Points
-   A class can inherit from only one class in C# (single inheritance), but it can implement multiple interfaces.
-   Inheritance helps in promoting the concept of reusability and reduces code redundancy.
#### Can you explain the difference between inheritance and composition?
**Answer:**
Inheritance is the concept of one class inheriting the functionality of another class, while composition involves one class containing an instance of another class to use its functionality. Composition is generally preferred over inheritance to promote flexibility and reduce tight coupling between classes.
